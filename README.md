# User Stories
As a Reviewer, I want an estimation for the sum of all User Stories and a deadline for receiving the result.
As a Reviewer, I want an mobile application that can show the weather data that is supplied by my server: (https://us-central1-mobile-assignment-server.
cloudfunctions.net/weather).
As a User, I want to see a home screen with all the cities that are available on the API.
As a User, I want the cities be sorted alphabetically.
As a User, I want to be able to refresh the data that is on the home screen.
As a User, I want to be able to click on a city and see the weather results on a separate screen.
As a User, I want all the temperatures to be displayed in Celsius. The API returns also Fahrenheit and Kelvin, so they need to be converted:
Celsius = Kelvin - 273.15 Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) / 1.8
As a User, I want the temperatures to be displayed in chronological order.
As a Reviewer, I want a subject in the README.md explaining the chosen architecture.
As a Reviewer, I want the application to be offline-first. The data must be fetched from the API and must be stored in a database. If there is no internet the data from the database must be used.
As a Reviewer, I want the application delivered in a zipped Git repo. The Git repo may not be published to a public location.
As a Reviewer, I want the application only to be optimized for mobile devices and in Portrait mode.
As a Reviewer, I want a report of User Stories that couldn't be finished or have a comment. Please add it to the README.md of your project.
